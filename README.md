# MateInGreen
Chess, in python! Credits to the chess library ([PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/chess/)). The app uses pygame to render and open a window, so you can enjoy chess with a really horrible bot..

## How to run

 1. Clone the repository: <br> `git clone https://github.com/NimitVijayvargee/MateInGreen.git`
 2. Create a virtual environment <br> `python -m venv /path/to/the/code`
 3. Install the dependencies <br> `pip install chess` <br>  `pip install pygame`
 4. Run `index.py` using `python index.py` in the folder
 5. Play chess against trashbot (it has a name now :O)

## Future features

 1. Underpromotion (enjoy having only queens)
 2. A bot that is actually hard to play against
 3. Better UI with sounds and a move recording system
 4. Exporting FEN and PGN from the game (sounds harder than it actually is tbh)
